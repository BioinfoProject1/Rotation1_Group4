# Introduction
This project is about LIFE4136 being carried out in Group4 of Rotation1. This research project is about the strain of a microorganism. We need to study which places or parts of the genome have been modified and where what changes have occurred. Our data includes short-read (Illumina data) and long-read data for some samples, but the majority of the samples only have long-read data. We want a collection of these genomes to determine what has happened to them.
